Thank you for using Hamsters.js! In order to best assist you please follow the guidelines laid out below as they will help significantly in resolving your issues. Tickets that do not follow the provided issue template have less than satisfactory information to resolve the problem reported and will therefore not receive priority support.

### Be polite and courteous 

Attitude goes a long way, while we do our best to ensure the library is problem free it is a very complicated library that encapsulates many features all while trying to support as many platforms as possible. Inevitably some issues may prop up from time to time, patience, understanding, and collaboration are the best ways to resolve bugs in a timely manner.

### New Issue Report

* ***What version of the library are you using?***

This will help narrow down the issue you are facing to a specific release of the library, as your issue may be resolved in previous or latter releases.

* ***What operating system are you seeing the issue on?***

Feature support can vary wildly and any issues you are facing may be exclusive to a specific operating system or even a specific version of an operating system.

* ***Which platform (and or) browser are you seeing the issue on?***

Some issues may be isolated to specific environments or systems, an issue you are facing in Node.js for example may not be applicable to React Native.

* ***What is the version of the platform (and or) browser you are seeing the issue on?***

Feature support can vary wildly and any issues you are facing may be exclusive to a specific browser or framework and specific versions of a browser or framework.

* ***Example logic***

Being able to reproduce an issue directly goes a very long way towards debugging issues with the library, having example logic is probably the most important step you can take towards helping us resolve your issues.
